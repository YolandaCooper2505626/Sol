Sol° for iOS
===

Sol° beautifully displays weather information so you can plan your day accordingly. 
Check the weather in your current location or any city around the world. 

Usage
---

Sol° uses the Wunderground.com Weather API for all of its weather data. In order to build for your own device, 
you will need to obtain an API key here: http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api

Your Wunderground API key should be written to a file named "API_KEY" and imported into your project. 

Sol° requires iOS 7 and Xcode 5.
